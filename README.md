# pyProtein
pyProtein does basic calculations on polypeptides/
proteins/enzymes, *e.g.* the isoelectric point similar to *e.g.* the "ExPASy
Compute pI/Mw tool". Methods are contained in class polyampholyte. Is intended
to be included into scripts for automated calculations.

Currently only calculations for compounds with amino acid residues (proteins/
enzymes/polypeptides) are supported: 
* Input as amino acid abundance or amino acid sequence.
* Currently contains *p*K<sub>a</sub> tables from three sources for IEP and
charge calculation.
* Calculates charge states of polyamphlytes depending on pH values.

For imformation on how to use it:
* See docstrings.
* Or look at how the tests are done in the tests folder.
